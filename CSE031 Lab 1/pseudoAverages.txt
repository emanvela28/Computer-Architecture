initialize variables for current value, sumofeven, sumofodd, evenaverage, oddaverage, evencounter, oddcounter, totalcounter

set totalcounter equal to 1

ask user for integer value and save as current value
while current values does not equal 0
    if sum of digits of current val % 2 = 0
        add current value to sumofeven
        add 1 to even counter
    else
        add current value to sumofodd
        add 1 to odd counter
    add 1 to total counter
    ask user for integer value and save as current value

evenaverage is equal to sumofeven / evencounter
oddaverage is equal to sumofodd / oddcounter

print evenaverage
print oddaverage
