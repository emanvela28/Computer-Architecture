TPS Activity 1
1. I expect the program to print the value 2.
2. I expect it to print out a hexidecimal value.
3. It did print out a hexidecimal value, it prtined: 44434241
4. It prints the value 2, I am lost by the result.
5a. I array is allocated in the program.
5b. Yes they point to the same location.
5c. Yes they point to the same place and my code confirms this.
6. The difference between twon ints is 4. It shows how they addresses are stored in memory.
7. Did on paper
8. The difference in the addresses is one, this shows how characters are stored in memory.
9. Done on the same paper
10. This shows that C allows us to access the same memory location using different types of pointers.The first element of four_int 
    was only changed because the character pointer did all of the work inside the first index. This is because 4 characters make 
    the same size as one integer.

TPS Activity 2
1. This line dynamically allocates memory for array pointers to in, where it is going to be a 2D array
2. To access the ith value of the ray it will be done like this: *(arr + i)
3. Done.
4. We have to pass the size of the array in order to tell the program when to stop the function.
5. Done.
6. Done.
7. Done.
