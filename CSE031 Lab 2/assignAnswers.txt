Individual activity 1
1. Line 25 causes the segmentation fault
2. In the scanf function, it is important to derefernce the input variable like so &input.
3. The bug here is that we are not updating the sum varibale after the unput.
4. To fix it, we must declare sum as a pointer in the read values function, and then pass sum by reference on line 33.

Individual assignment 2 appendTest.c
1. The output is not expected. It should reprint the inputs as provided, however, for "hello!" it prints "hello!llo!"
2. The output is not expected again. The bug seems to be in the for loop where k is not iterating through both strings, only str2.
   This would mean that the string is not being displayed properly.
3. The output is not expected here either. This is because in main, char str1 and char str2 are declared with a size of 10 and  
   the size of the tring we are trying to input is bigger than 10 characters.
