TPS Activity 1
1. text: 0x00400000
   data: 0x10010000
2. Basic is languge that is easily converted to machine code. Source code is the code that we write.
3. There is a four byte difference
4. There are 16 columns
5. Because there are 16 columns in hex, there is a 32 bit difference.
6. .data
   m: .word 20
   .text
   lw $t0, m
7. 268500996
8. str1: .asciiz "I love CSE31!"
9. Stored here: 0x01001000 with these 3 values: 825443667, 1126196598, 1869357129
10. All computers use little endian and the data is stored in little endian format which prompts the computer to read from left to right.
11. Use Li to print
    li $v0, 4
    la $a0, str1
    syscall
12. a $t3, n loads the address of n in the $t3 register. The value of $t3 will be the value in the address of n.


TPS Activity 2
1. Because it is redundant
2. n: .word 25
3. Done
4. li $v0, 5 
5. Slt $t0, $sl, $s0
   Bne $t0, $zero, LESS
6. Beq $t0, $zero, GREQ
7. Done
8. Beq $t0, $rero, LEEQ
